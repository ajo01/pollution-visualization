# About

This is re-creation of a section of Jamie Kettle's Who is bottling plastic waste pollution? graphic design with D3.js. It explores which countries in 2010 produced the largest amounts of plastic waste and what percentage of this was inadequately managed, and how this management correlates to GDP per capita.

The countries are ordered in descending order by plastic waste generated per year. The bar chart displays the share of plastic inadequately managed and the area chart on the far right demonstrates GDP per capita. The color groups countries by region.

Through this project, I found that the original design did not reflect the actual data. This explains some of the discrepancies between the original and this visualization. For example, in Jamie Kettle's design, China was reportedly the #1 contributor of plastic waste with 59.1 million tonnes generated per year. However, in the dataset China actually generated 31.6 million tonnes.
