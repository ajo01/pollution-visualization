    <h1>Who is bottling plastic waste pollution?</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <div class="description">
      This is a re-creation of a section of Jamie Kettle's
      <span>Who is bottling plastic waste pollution?</span> graphic design with
      D3.js. It explores which countries in 2010 produced the largest amounts of
      plastic waste, what percentage of this was inadequately managed, and how
      this management correlates to GDP per capita.
    </div>
    <div class="description">
      The countries are ordered in descending order by plastic waste generated
      per year. The bar chart displays the share of plastic inadequately managed
      and the area chart on the far right demonstrates GDP per capita. The color
      groups countries by region.
